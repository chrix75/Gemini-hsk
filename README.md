Gemini-hsk
==========

Purpose
-------

The Gemini package provides functions to search the likeness between expressions.
These functions may be used for data matching to mark duplicate values.

History
-------
My work is to write programs which processes data to compare them each other, search duplicates in database or give score about data quality. When I started learning Haskell, I had the idea to develop a library about what I know well :)

The Gemini functions offer you some of my knowledge about data processing. I hope these functions will be useful for you.
